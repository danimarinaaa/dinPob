@article{ILLMAN2000631,
abstract = {Abstract The calorific value of five strains of Chlorella grown in Watanabe and low-nitrogen medium was determined. The algae were grown in small (2L) stirred tank bioreactors and the best growth was obtained with Chlorella vulgaris with a growth rate of 0.99 dâˆ’1 and the highest calorific value (29 KJ/g) was obtained with C. emersonii. The cellular components were assayed at the end of the growth period and the calorific value appears to be linked to the lipid content rather than any other component.},
