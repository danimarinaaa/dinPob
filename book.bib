@article{ILLMAN2000631,
abstract = {Abstract The calorific value of five strains of Chlorella grown in Watanabe and low-nitrogen medium was determined. The algae were grown in small (2L) stirred tank bioreactors and the best growth was obtained with Chlorella vulgaris with a growth rate of 0.99 d−1 and the highest calorific value (29 KJ/g) was obtained with C. emersonii. The cellular components were assayed at the end of the growth period and the calorific value appears to be linked to the lipid content rather than any other component.},

@book{reprodCodeBES,
abstract = {The way we do science is changing — data are getting bigger, analyses are getting more complex, and governments, funding agencies and the scientific method itself demand more transparency and accountability in research. One way to deal with these changes is to make our research more reproducible, especially our code. Although most of us now write code to perform our analyses, it is often not very reproducible. We have all come back to a piece of work we have not looked at for a while and had no idea what our code was doing or which of the many "final{\_} analysis" scripts truly was the final analysis! Unfortunately, the number of tools for reproducibility and all the jargon can leave new users feeling overwhelmed, with no idea how to start making their code more reproducible. So, we have put together this guide to help.},
